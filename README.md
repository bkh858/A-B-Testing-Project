# Rocket Fuel: Measuring the Effectiveness of Online Advertising
by Betty Hagos

# Background:
## Rocket Fuel is an AI-driven ad tech company with a client, Taskabella, that sells handbags. They recently ran an A/B test and need to present the results to the client, emphasizing the positive ROI. This is a randomized control trial with a control group that saw PSAs and a treatment group that was shown the ad. However, the control group is 4% of the entire sample population because of the real world opportunity cost problem of not showing all users ads. The number of "impressions" varied and so did the day of the week and time of day. Given the experimental design & results, we must analyze the data as if we are data scientists and present a report of findings and recommendations to the client.
# The Goal :
## to address a series of questions about marketing effectiveness, profitability, impression effectiveness, and day/hour effects.
